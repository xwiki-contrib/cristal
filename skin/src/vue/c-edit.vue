  <!-- When the user is on an edit page with the editor displayed, and a new page is created, the editor is not refreshed.
       Due lots of state variables in the editor component, it is arguably preferable to refresh the entire component to make it aware of the new document.

      Ths <CDocumentRefresher> component helps with that: the c-edit component, which is in charge of displaying the selected editor, watches the current document.
      When it changes, the underlying editor component is un-mounted then re-mounted using Vue's builtin key mechanism, which forces re-mounting.
